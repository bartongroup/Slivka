Welcome to slivka's documentation!
==================================

Slivka is free software, that assists you in creating web services for
command-line programs. You can use it to easily let others access the
tools installed on your local computer, server or computer cluster
over HTTP through a convenient REST interface. It also integrates with
SLURM and Univa/Altair Grid Engine workload managers and can use them
to execute jobs more efficiently on distributed computing systems.
Slivka is written in Python and is available both as a source code and
an anaconda package.
